## Description
> ***Terminologies*** :\
> ***1. Regression : Analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.***\
> ***2. Linear regression : A basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis which usually works on continuous data.***\
> ***3. Polynomial regression : A special case of linear regression where we fit a polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the target variable and the independent variables.***\

- Web-Application of your statistical data. which displays **WHAT IS DECIDED? and WHAT IS ACHIEVED?** by you in timeline
- Implemented Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to display the prediction analysis of the overall data.
- Generic Implementation for use of several purpose

## Requirements
- Excel Sheet (3 columns - 1. Date (MM/DD/YYYY) Type Date, 2. What is achieved?, 3. What was decided?)
- Please refer the dataset for reference
  - https://github.com//AkshayZade1995/self-progress-tracker/raw/master/sample-dataset-1.xlsx
  - https://github.com//AkshayZade1995/self-progress-tracker/raw/master/sample-dataset-2.xlsx
  - https://github.com//AkshayZade1995/self-progress-tracker/raw/master/sample-dataset-3.xlsx

## Examples
* **CASE OF STUDY**
1. Suppose you decided to study for whole day and only studied for half day of it\
   (Dataset = Date : 01/01/2021, Achieved : 50%, Decided : 100% )  
2. Due to several reasons you have 60% of day only for study and you study 50% of it\
   (Dataset = Date : 02/01/2021, Achieved : 50%, Decided : 60% )  
3. Decided to study 70% in day and achieved 70%\
   (Dataset = Date : 03/01/2021, Achieved : 70%, Decided : 70% )\

* **CASE OF PROGRAMMING**
1. Suppose you decided to solve 5 Data Structure Problems and solved 3\
   (Dataset = Date : 01/01/2021, Achieved : 3, Decided : 5 )  
2. Suppose you decided to solve 10 Data Structure Problems and solved 10\
   (Dataset = Date : 01/01/2021, Achieved : 10, Decided : 10 )  
2. Suppose you decided to solve 15 Hard Data Structure Problems and solved 9\
   (Dataset = Date : 01/01/2021, Achieved : 9, Decided : 15 )  

**Conclusion : Maintain and Import excel sheet to web-application and it will predict your analysis and display your improvements and failures**
